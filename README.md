Dinosaur
===

Description
---

Simple reproduction of Google Chrome's offline dinosaur game with a self-developing AI playing it.  
This project uses [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) to develop artificial neural networks from scratch and train them to be able to play said dinosaur game.

Heavily inspired by CodeBullet's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_IGstiWlc) on the same topic.

Clarification:  
This project has been developed locally and without version control and only recently been uploaded to GitHub for sharing purposes.
